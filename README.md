# tortia
 A tool for converting OpenMPT tracker data to Atari2600 assembly in .tia format
 
 This was written back in 2013 and was my very first program using any language. Back then there were no accessible tools available for writing 2600 music, so I attempted to merge the accesibility of openMPT with Paul Slocum's tia music maker software. Essentially, tortia is a text converter between openMPT pattern data and the assembly format that slocum's program reads. This is all then compiled to .tia format anc played through the included emulator.
